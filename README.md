# Student Management System


## Introduction

This Student Management System was developed as the final requirement for PF-101. The goal of the system is to provide a structured and efficient platform for managing student information, academic records, subject assignments, and teacher data. The project demonstrates the application of programming fundamentals, Java OOP principles, and GUI development using JavaFX.

The system was built using the following technologies:

* Java
* JavaFX
* NetBeans IDE
* XAMPP (MySQL)
* CSS (Interface Styling)
